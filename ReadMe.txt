Prediction of diabetes - Type 2 (Mellitus)

This is a machine learning project based on the prediction of type 2 diabetes using SVM, DT, RF, XGBOOST and KNN to classify the diabetic outcome.
The T2DM cases are on the increase and this is due to changing life style, late diagnosing is primary reason why we now have highcases experienced.

The type 2 diabetes is commonly called diabetes mellitus. It can be defined as a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). 
We consider the mellitus here. After several researches we found that, some parameters are directly responsible for the mellitus to occur. 
By using the data of the patients with diabetes and without diabetes, a dataset has been build. We use that dataset to classify the people who are in the risk of getting diabetes.
